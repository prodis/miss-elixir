## New features

For proposing new features, please start a discussion opening [an issue](https://github.com/prodis/miss-elixir/issues).
Describe the new feature, add scenarios and use cases for the new function/module, and provide
some usage examples.

Do not open a pull request with the proposed new feature. If you are proposing a new feature and
you want to implement it, you can open a pull request after the new feature is approved. :smile:

## Bug fixes, documentation and code refactoring

For bug fixes, improving documentation, and code refactoring, please open a pull request with your
changes.

## Pull request guideline

- Check out the latest master to make sure the feature has not been implemented or the bug has not been fixed yet.
- Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already has not requested it and/or contributed it.
- Fork the project.
- Start a feature/bugfix branch.
- Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
- Do not forget to rebase with branch master in the main project before submit the pull request.
- Make sure to add tests for it.
- Please do not change the mix file, version, or changelog.
